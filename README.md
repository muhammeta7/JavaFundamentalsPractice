  * lengthOfLastWord: Given string with spaces return length of last word in string.
  * reverseString: Return identical string the characters in opposite order.
  * getMiddleCharacter: Return middle character of a given word.
  * removeCharacter: Given character and word return word without character.
  * getLastWord: Return last word of given string,
  * acronym: Given string return first letter of each word capitalized.
